Very well done. Your score is 98. 

My comments are below:

-1. OLS assumes homoscedasticity, not heteroscedasticity.
Your indication of the alternative hypothesis has a typo - you re-type the H0.

-1. Logistic regression requires a sample size of at least 50 per predictor.
Pearson correlations are used to examine linear associations, and we use them here to assess multicollinearity.

+1. Great job re: interpreting AUC

+1. Great job re: choosing the simpler model as the better one!

-2. No real need for approaches proposed for Paul Allison because you have more than 2000 observations in the rarer category.
